##Description
The Snakes and Ladders game is a popular board game that involves players moving pieces based on the dice rolls. The objective is to navigate from the start to the end of the board, climbing ladders and avoiding snakes that move the player back. This code describes the implementation of a Snakes and Ladders game simulation in Python, including code for defining the board, simulating the game, tracking statistics.
I've made use of PIL.PIL -Stands for Python Imaging Library.
It is used for opening and manipulating and saving images in python.
From PIL we are importing the Image :
             It helps in opening and doing basic operations in the image
             Image.open()-It helps to open the image.
             Image.show()-It helps to display the image.
